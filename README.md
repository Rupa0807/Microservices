# 30 Days of Microservices Learning Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my **30 Days of Microservices** learning journey! In this repository, I document my daily progress as I dive deep into the world of microservices, breaking down complex concepts, exploring best practices, and building hands-on projects.

## Why Microservices? üßë‚Äçüíª

Microservices architecture has become a popular style for building modern applications. By decomposing a large system into smaller, loosely coupled services, teams can build and deploy independently, making systems more scalable, maintainable, and easier to evolve. My goal is to get a deeper understanding of this architecture style by learning through theory and practice over the next 30 days.
